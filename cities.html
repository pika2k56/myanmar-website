		<td align="center"><p>Mandalay is the second-largest city in <br>Myanmar, after Yangon. Located on the east bank <br>
		of the Irrawaddy River, 631 km (392 miles;<br> road distance) north of Yangon, the city has<br> a population of 1,225,553 (2014 census).<br>

		Mandalay was founded in 1857 by King Mindon, <br>replacing Amarapura as the new royal capital<br> of the Konbaung dynasty. It was Burma's final <br>royal capital before the kingdom's annexation by <br>
		the British Empire in 1885. Under British rule,<br> Mandalay remained commercially and culturally<br> important despite the rise of Yangon, the new<br> capital of British Burma. The city suffered <br>extensive destruction during the Japanese <br>conquest of Burma in the Second World War.<br> In 1948, Mandalay became part of the newly <br>independent Union of Burma.</p></td>

		<td align="center"><u><b><h2>YANGON</h2></b></u></td>
		<td align="center"><p>Yangon, formerly romanized as Rangoon,<br> is the capital of the Yangon Region and the<br> largest city of Myanmar (also known as Burma).<br> Yangon served as the capital of Myanmar until<br> 2006, when the military government relocated<br> the administrative functions to the purpose-built<br> capital city of Naypyidaw in north central<br> Myanmar. With over five million people,<br> Yangon is Myanmar's most populous city and<br> its most important commercial centre.<br>

		Yangon boasts the largest number of colonial-era<br> buildings in Southeast Asia, and has a unique<br> colonial-era urban core that is remarkably <br>intact. The colonial-era commercial core is <br>centered around the Sule Pagoda, which is<br> reputed to be over 2,000 years old. The city<br> is also home to the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda<br> – Myanmar's most sacred and famous Buddhist pagoda.</p></td>

		<td align="center"><u><b><h2>NAY PYI TAW</h2></b></u></td>
		<td align="center"><p>Naypyidaw, officially romanized<br> Nay Pyi Taw Nepranytau; pronounced  lit.<br> 'Grand Capital'), is the capital and third-largest<br> city of Myanmar. The city is located at the <br>centre of the Naypyidaw Union Territory.<br> It is unusual among Myanmar's cities in that <br>it is an entirely planned city outside of any<br> state or region. The city, then known only as<br> Pyinmana District, officially replaced Yangon<br> as the administrative capital of Myanmar on<br> 6 November 2005; its official name was revealed<br> to the public on Armed Forces Day, 27 March 2006.<br>

		As the seat of the government of Myanmar,<br>Naypyidaw is the site of the Union Parliament,<br> the Supreme Court, the Presidential Palace,<br> the official residences of the Cabinet of<br> Myanmar and the headquarters of government<br> ministries and military. Naypyidaw is notable<br> for its unusual combination of large size and <br>very low population density. The city hosted<br> the 24th and 25th ASEAN Summit, the 3rd<br> BIMSTEC Summit, the Ninth East Asia Summit,<br> the 2013 Southeast Asian Games and the 2014<br> AFC U-19 Championship.</p></td>
